      <description>Module translation The module&amp;rsquo;s text strings are written in English, but you might want French, Spanish or Polish shop owners to use your module too. You therefore have to translate those strings into those languages, both the front office and the back office strings. Ideally, you should translate your module in all the languages that are installed on your shop. This could be a tedious task, but a whole system has been put in place in order to help you out.</description>

      <description>How to register a new Hook in PrestaShop This is basically three steps:

      <description>How to compile assets Some components in PrestaShop, like Javascript or SCSS files, need to be compiled to be usable.
Requirements We use Webpack to compile assets. You only need NodeJS 8.x (get it here), NPM will take care of it all.
Assets that need to be compiled  Back Office
 Default theme  SASS files

      <title>Right-To-Left languages</title>
      <link>https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/development/rtl/</link>

      <description>Right-to-Left languages PrestaShop supports Right-to-Left (RTL) languages natively, both in the Back Office and the Front Office. It can automatically transform themes to make them compatible with RTL languages.
Any Front Office theme can be transformed automatically by PrestaShop. Read &amp;ldquo;RTL support&amp;rdquo; in the Themes section to learn more about this system.
Back Office support The Back Office uses the same &amp;ldquo;theme-flipping&amp;rdquo; system as the Front Office feature. While for Front Office themes the transformation procedure must be triggered manually, in the BO this is performed automatically whenever an RTL language is activated on the shop, either by installing an RTL language or by setting up a language as RTL via edit in the BO.</description>
