      <description>Configuration Data can be saved in the shop database without requiring a module specific table to be created.
The table configuration contains a list of key =&amp;gt; value(s) properties which can be accessed from anywhere, including in a module. The Configuration class is the interface allowing each module developer to get or store data in this table.
Store configuration data Configuration::updateValue(string $key, mixed $value);  $key will be the reference to your data to reuse later.</description>

      <description>The DBQuery class The DBQuery class is a query builder which helps you create SQL queries. For instance:
$sql = new DbQuery(); $sql-&amp;gt;select(&#39;*&#39;); $sql-&amp;gt;from(&#39;cms&#39;, &#39;c&#39;); $sql-&amp;gt;innerJoin(&#39;cms_lang&#39;, &#39;l&#39;, &#39;c.id_cms = l.id_cms AND l.id_lang = &#39;.(int)$id_lang); $sql-&amp;gt;where(&#39;c.active = 1&#39;); $sql-&amp;gt;orderBy(&#39;position&#39;); return Db::getInstance()-&amp;gt;executeS($sql);  Main methods  __toString()  Generate and get the query. build()  Generate and get the query (return a string). from(string $table, mixed $alias = null)  Set table for FROM clause.</description>

      <description>Why write technical documentation?  The best documentation is no documentation: code should be self-explanatory.
All the lazy developers in history
 Writing documentation is hard.
We try to find excuses and rationalize and lie to ourselves so we can feel better about with the fact that we should be doing it, but it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;too much work&amp;rdquo;.
Here are two good reasons to try and convince you to start writing documentation, and help you while you help others, too:</description>

      <description>Adding module links in the back-office side menu  On the PrestaShop back office, the links on the side menu are linked to AdminControllers and ModuleAdminController classes. The first ones come from the PrestaShop Core, but the second ones are defined by the modules. If you want to add a link to your ModuleAdminControllers in the back office sidebar, this guide is for you.
Tabs registration In order to register new links, open your main module class.</description>

      <description>How to become a Core Contributor using Docker If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, thank you! This means you&amp;rsquo;re interested on contributing to PrestaShop. You probably are a PrestaShop developer, and your use of the project is slighty different from ours. For instance, there are little differences between PrestaShop 1.7 (the release) and the branch 1.7 of PrestaShop in GitHub repository. This is because we create a release usable by everyone from our sources.</description>

      <description>Module file structure A module is made of a lot of files, all stored in a folder that bears the same name as the module, that folder being in turn stored in the /modules folder at the root of the main PrestaShop folder: /modules/&amp;lt;name_of_the_module&amp;gt;/.
Here are the possible files and folders for a PrestaShop 1.7 module:

      <description>Front controllers These class are accessible from the front-office and add features to the customers.
Creating a front controller In order to have a front controller read by PrestaShop, these 3 rules have to be followed:
 it is stored in the subfolder controllers/front/ of the module. in CamelCase, the class name follows this format: &amp;lt;ModuleName&amp;gt;&amp;lt;FileName&amp;gt;ModuleFrontController. it extends the class ModuleFrontController.  Minimum controller example Let&amp;rsquo;s say we want a controller responsible of payments validation in our module cheque.</description>

      <description>List of hooks in PrestaShop 1.7 Update notes A couple of hooks were modified between 1.7.0.x and 1.7.1.x.
 actionDeleteProductInCartAfter has been divided into two hooks:  actionObjectProductInCartDeleteBefore. actionObjectProductInCartDeleteAfter.  displayProductButtons has been renamed into displayProductAdditionalInfo.
Don’t worry, we kept an alias :)  Full list  action&amp;lt;AdminControllerName&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Action&amp;gt;After Called after performing &amp;lt;Action&amp;gt; in any &amp;lt;AdminController&amp;gt;
Located in: /classes/controller/AdminController.php
Parameters:
array( &#39;controller&#39; =&amp;gt; (AdminController), &#39;return&#39; =&amp;gt; (mixed) );  action&amp;lt;AdminControllerName&amp;gt;&amp;lt;Action&amp;gt;Before Called before performing &amp;lt;Action&amp;gt; in any &amp;lt;AdminController&amp;gt;</description>

      <guid>https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/development/database/objectmodel/</guid>
      <description>The ObjectModel class When needing to dive deep, you have to use the ObjectModel class. This is the main object of PrestaShop’s object model. It can be overridden… with precaution.
It is an Active Record kind of class (see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern). The table attributes or view attributes of PrestaShop’s database are encapsulated in this class. Therefore, the class is tied to a database record. After the object has been instantiated, a new record is added to the database.</description>

      <guid>https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/development/components/grid-component/</guid>
      <description>The Grid component  The Grid component specifies for a Grid (Table + action + bulk actions) the definition of columns, the query builder used to retrieve data and how the search filters must be used to retrieve the data displayed.
Not only this gives a consistent representation of the data from a &amp;ldquo;PHP/Back&amp;rdquo; point of view, but the component also provides a minimalist Twig/Javascript layer for the rendering based on a typed View model.</description>

      <description>How to benchmark your PrestaShop Shop (Back-office) Benchmark methodology In order to benchmark the performances of the backoffice of your shop, you will use the Gatling testing tool.
 Note: Backoffice benchmark is only possible starting with prestashop 1.7.4.0!
If you want still want to run the test for version &amp;lt; 1.7.4.0, take a look at this PR: https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/8876
 What is Gatling? Gatling is a stress tool. Development is currently focusing on HTTP support.</description>

It is used one time, during the installation of PrestaShop. It contains the structure of almost all tables. If a table needs to be added or modified, this the file you should open.

      <description>Use hooks on modern pages You know you can already customize your PrestaShop store thanks to many hooks: the good news is that you can still use hooks like you did in the earlier versions of PrestaShop in modern pages.
Starting from PrestaShop 1.7.3, you can access the modern Services Container into your modules and so on access powerful and customizable features available in Symfony:
 Twig, the most popular templating engine; Swiftmailer, a feature-rich mailer; Doctrine ORM and Doctrine DBAL to manage your database; Filesystem and Finder libraries to manage all filesystem operations; Monolog for every logging operations; Serializer library for whom who need to manipulate Json and Xml formats&amp;hellip;  Of course, you also have access to every service used by the Core of PrestaShop.</description>

      <description>Widgets Widget is an advanced concept introduced on PrestaShop 1.7, extending hooks feature.
Limitation of hooks In their basic use, a display hook will be shown at a specific place in the template. If a module wants to display the same additional content on several places, whatever the merchant chose, it still has to register and implement all the possible hooks.
With widgets, module developers can display content everywhere the module is asked to do so.</description>

      <guid>https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/modules/creation/adding-configuration-page/</guid>
      <description>Adding a configuration page Your module can get a &amp;ldquo;Configure&amp;rdquo; link in the back office module list, and therefore let the user change some settings. This &amp;ldquo;Configure&amp;rdquo; link appears with addition of the getContent() method to your main class. This is a standard PrestaShop method: its sole existence sends a message to the back office, saying &amp;ldquo;there&amp;rsquo;s a configuration page in this module, display the configuration link&amp;rdquo;.
But having a getContent() public method in the MyModule object does only make the &amp;ldquo;Configure&amp;rdquo; link appear; it does not create the configuration page out of nowhere.</description>

      <description>Alter forms on modern pages  One of the most common tasks for the PrestaShop developers is to alter the data and make it manageable for customers. In PrestaShop 1.6, a specific Form framework was created to help developers. In PrestaShop 1.7, the system has changed as we now rely on the Symfony Form component.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see an example on how to add, populate, validate and persist a new form field in PrestaShop 1.</description>

      <guid>https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/modules/concepts/templating/admin-views/</guid>
      <description>How to override Back Office views  Since PrestaShop 1.7, the back office is being progressively migrated to the Symfony framework. Even though modules are no longer allowed to override a complete controller like before (it was highly discouraged anyway), we have introduced new powerful and more efficient ways to customize the Back Office.
As part of this migration, PrestaShop is switching its templating engine from Smarty to Twig. Twig is very popular in the PHP/Symfony world, it&amp;rsquo;s well-documented and it&amp;rsquo;s also one of the most efficient engines out there.</description>

  KPI Block   You can follow these steps to easily add a KPI row to a modern page:
 Define your KPI classes:  You can use one of existing KPI classes, from PrestaShop\PrestaShop\Adapter\Kpi namespace, You can create new classes - they must implement the PrestaShop\PrestaShop\Core\Kpi\KpiInterface  Define a KPI row factory service in src/PrestaShopBundle/Resources/config/services/core/kpi.</description>

      <guid>https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/modules/creation/displaying-content-in-front-office/</guid>
      <description>Displaying content on the front office As it is, the module does not do much. In order to display something on the front office, we have to add support for a few hooks. This is done by implementing the hooks&amp;rsquo; methods, and that was actually done in the install() method we wrote earlier, using the registerHook() method:
public function install() { if (Shop::isFeatureActive()) { Shop::setContext(Shop::CONTEXT_ALL); } return parent::install() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; $this-&amp;gt;registerHook(&#39;leftColumn&#39;) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; $this-&amp;gt;registerHook(&#39;header&#39;) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Configuration::updateValue(&#39;MYMODULE_NAME&#39;, &#39;my friend&#39;); }  As you can see, we make it so that the module is hooked to the &amp;ldquo;leftColumn&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;header&amp;rdquo; hooks.</description>

      <description>Fundamentals of PrestaShop Development PrestaShop was conceived so that third-party modules could easily build upon its foundations, making it an extremely customizable e-commerce software.
PrestaShop’s customization is based on three possibilities:
 Themes, Modules, Overriding.  Themes are explored in full in the Designer Guide.
Modules and the override system are explored in this Developer Guide, starting with the “Concepts” section below. You can learn more about each in the following chapters:</description>

      <guid>https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/modules/concepts/overrides/</guid>
      <description>Overrides Overriding is a way to &amp;ldquo;override&amp;rdquo; class files and controller files. PrestaShop&amp;rsquo;s ingenious class auto-loading function makes the &amp;ldquo;switch&amp;rdquo; to other files fairly simple. Thanks to PrestaShop&amp;rsquo;s fully object-oriented code, you can rely on object inheritance to modify and add new behaviors, using the properties and methods of the various existing classes.
Important note There are limitations and risks of using overrides. Keep them for your own shop.</description>

      <description>Enabling the Auto-Update Since PrestaShop 1.5, it is possible to have your module auto-update: once a new version is available on Addons, PrestaShop suggests an &amp;ldquo;Update it!&amp;rdquo; button to the user. Clicking this button will trigger a series of methods, each leading closer to the latest version of your module.
In order to bring auto-update support to your module, you need three main things:
 Clearly indicate the module&amp;rsquo;s version number in its constructor method: $this-&amp;gt;version = &#39;1.</description>

      <description>Commands  Since version 1.7 of PrestaShop, everyone have access to the PrestaShop console using the following instruction in a terminal:
 ./bin/console # or ./app/console for PrestaShop &amp;lt; 1.7.3 
Since v1.7.5, you can add and provide your own commands into the PrestaShop console using modules.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see an example of a really common task when we usually use CRON scripts: you want to export your products into an XML file in order to import them into an another platform (a PIM or an ERP).</description>

      <description>Module translation The module&amp;rsquo;s text strings are written in English, but you might want French, Spanish or Polish shop owners to use your module too. You therefore have to translate those strings into those languages, both the front office and the back office strings. Ideally, you should translate your module in all the languages that are installed on your shop. This could be a tedious task, but a whole system has been put in place in order to help you out.</description>

      <description>Contribution guidelines Ready to contribute code? Here&amp;rsquo;s what you need to know to get your Pull Request accepted.
Commits Atomic commits In the past, we used to have only one commit by pull request. This was a bad habit. We now require contributors to make atomic commits, so you will surely have more than one commit in a single pull request. This will be helpful to review, cherry-pick or revert changes (we hope to never have to do that 😉).</description>

      <description>How to backup PrestaShop Before starting anything, you must think first about safety. Any modification made on a shop could break it, so you must make sure all your data has been backed up before going further. This basically implies saving two things: your files and your database.
We will give you all the details you may need to run an upgrade, but we can’t be held responsible for any damage caused to your shop during the process.</description>

      <description>How to edit a page on GitHub Editing a page on GitHub is the most stright-forward way of contributing content to PrestaShop DevDocs.
 The good: you don&amp;rsquo;t need to have anything installed. The bad: even if GitHub provides a preview of your markdown code, you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to see exactly how it will look like on the site (for instance, shortcodes aren&amp;rsquo;t interpreted by the GitHub preview).  For this tutorial, you will need a GitHub account (free).</description>

 Legacy tests: heritage from PrestaShop 1.6: mix of unit, integration and functional tests; Legacy controllers: added to help with the Symfony migration, ensures that old Back Office controllers are still runnable; Admin tests: specific to PrestaShop 1.7, tests src/Core and src/Adapter classes; Symfony specific tests: specific to PrestaShop 1.</description>

      <description>Setting up your local environment Now that you intend to building a theme for PrestaShop, you are better off keeping all your development work on your machine. The main advantage is that it makes it possible for you to entirely bypass the process of uploading your files on your online server in order to test your changes. Another advantage is that a local test environment enables you to test code without the risk of breaking your production store.</description>

      <description>Templates &amp;amp; layouts PrestaShop template file are based on the Smarty 3 template engine.
All template files must be stored in the theme&amp;rsquo;s templates/ subfolder. For instance, the default theme has its template files in the following folder: /themes/classic/templates.
Directory structure Templates are then split between various subfolders.
 /_partials/ Code shared accross the whole site like header, footer or notifications. /catalog/ Product page, product/brand/supplier listing, search result and such.</description>

      <guid>https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/development/architecture/migration-guide/templating-with-twig/</guid>
      <description>Templating with Twig This is mostly the easy part. Legacy pages use Smarty while modern pages use Twig. These templating engines are actually similar in many ways.
For instance, this is a legacy template:
&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;employee_avatar_small&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;img&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; src=&amp;quot;{$employee_image}&amp;quot; /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; {$employee_name}  All of the legacy templates are located in the admin-dev/themes/default/template/controller folder
 &amp;hellip; and here is a possible migration of it to Twig:
&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;employee_avatar_small&amp;quot;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;img class=&amp;quot;img&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;{{ employee.</description>

      <description>Testing What makes a theme valid When you&amp;rsquo;re trying to select a theme in the backoffice, PrestaShop will test if your theme is valid. It won&amp;rsquo;t install if the theme isn&amp;rsquo;t valid.
A theme is valid if it contains some files and some configuration keys.
Required files Here is the complete list of required files:
 preview.png config/theme.yml assets/js/theme.js assets/css/theme.css templates/_partials/form-field.tpl templates/catalog/product.tpl templates/catalog/listing/product-list.tpl templates/checkout/cart.tpl templates/checkout/checkout.tpl templates/cms/category.tpl templates/cms/page.tpl templates/customer/address.tpl templates/customer/addresses.tpl templates/customer/guest-tracking.</description>

      <description>Understanding the &amp;ldquo;src&amp;rdquo; folder The main idea when doing the 1.7 release was to use Symfony as a replacement for our own PrestaShop framework.
In &amp;ldquo;src&amp;rdquo; folder you&amp;rsquo;ll find 3 main folders with different purposes:
 Core: the refactored classes or business logic extraction for PrestaShop 1.7; Adapter: the classes that still depends on legacy framework (Context, Dispatcher or constants for instance); PrestaShopBundle: the classes that acts as a glue between PrestaShop classes and Symfony  Core .</description>

      <description>Configuring PrestaShop By default, PrestaShop is configured to provide a secure and stable environment to both the shop administrator and the customers.
As a developer, there are several changes that you could and should bring to the default installation in order to help you code better, spot bugs faster, and generally make a great PrestaShop product.
Disabling the cache and forcing Smarty compilation When your development has an impact on the front office, whether you are building a theme or simply a module which displays information to the customer, you should force the template file compilation and disable the cache, so as to always see the result of your changes directly.</description>

      <guid>https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/development/architecture/migration-guide/forms/</guid>
      <description>Forms Legacy forms Forms are the biggest part of the migration. Before, we had form helpers that took care of generating, validating and handling everything. In Symfony, every step (creation, validation and request handling) needs to be specified by the developer.
For instance, this is code that you can find in a Legacy Controller:
$this-&amp;gt;fields_options = array( &#39;general&#39; =&amp;gt; array( &#39;title&#39; =&amp;gt; $this-&amp;gt;trans(&#39;Logs by email&#39;, array(), &#39;Admin.Advparameters.Feature&#39;), &#39;icon&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;icon-envelope&#39;, &#39;fields&#39; =&amp;gt; array( &#39;PS_LOGS_BY_EMAIL&#39; =&amp;gt; array( &#39;title&#39; =&amp;gt; $this-&amp;gt;trans(&#39;Minimum severity level&#39;, array(), &#39;Admin.</description>

Assets PrestaShop 1.7 changed the way asset works and it means the way to it&amp;rsquo;s added inside the &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; tag of your page changed a bit too.
There are 2 importants files to use:
 _partials/stylesheets.tpl _partials/javascript.tpl  There 2 files are used to take full advantage of the new features of 1.</description>

      <description>How to create your own tests Creating a Unit test Everything is explained in the PHPUnit 5.7 documentation.
For unit tests, we strongly encourage you to base your test on the PHPUnit&amp;rsquo;s TestCase class only.
For instance:
namespace Tests\Unit\Foo; use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase; class BarTest extends TestCase { /* ... */ }  Unit tests should be located into Unit folder and follow the same path as the tested class: if a class is located into src/Core/Foo/Baz, the unit test should be into tests/Unit/Core/Foo/Baz folder.</description>

The database structure may change with each new release of PrestaShop, but major versions may also imply features being replaced, preventing a shop to be smoothly upgraded in some cases. For these shops, a migration is a solution to be able to keep up with new releases.</description>

      <description>Tooling prerequisites for theme designers The way 1.7 themes are created is significantly different from the way they were with PrestaShop 1.6. By taking the freedom to rewrite the way themes work according to the latest best-practices, we chose to also work with modern tools. These tools are widely accepted as best-of-breed in the current web development; hence, learning to use them will not only make you more productive in PrestaShop development, but more importantly in web development in general.</description>

 Every migrated page needs one or more Controllers: if you consider that a legacy Controller needs to be split into multiple controllers (for example: different URLs), it&amp;rsquo;s the right time to do it.
New controllers should be placed in the src/PrestaShopBundle/Controller/Admin folder. Starting on 1.7.3, controllers are being progressively organized in sub-folders following the Back Office menu.</description>

      <description>Notifications Throughout the whole front office, the customer can receive notification messages from PrestaShop, to inform about successes or errors for instance. Your theme can also send notifications when certain events occur.
The notification messages are not hard-coded in the template files, but are sent from the controller, so that you have consistency in case you update/change your theme. Thus, this way there is a better chance that all notification messages are already translated into your language!</description>

      <description>Starter Theme PrestaShop 1.7 introduces a new way for designers to create their theme from scratch: the Starter Theme. The default theme for PS 1.7 is based on the Starter Theme.
For pretty much every CMS, the default theme is used as a framework to build custom theme: designers have to rework the default theme and reshape it into what they want to display. Sometimes that means having to spend a lot of time removing all the CSS rules and JavaScript code from the default theme, and rewriting everything.</description>

      <description>How to migrate hooks Hooks are the most important feature for the PrestaShop developers because they allow them to improve PrestaShop by adding code or content in multiple points of the application. For Symfony developers, you can see that as Events on steroids. To keep some degree of compatibility with 1.6 or 1.7 (pre-Symfony migration) modules, we need to ensure that hooks are still available, invoked and/or rendered at the right place.</description>

In order to reduce code duplication, the only necessary template is the file catalog/listing/product-list.tpl.

      <description>Module translation The module&amp;rsquo;s text strings are written in English, but you might want French, Spanish or Polish shop owners to use your module too. You therefore have to translate those strings into those languages, both the front office and the back office strings. Ideally, you should translate your module in all the languages that are installed on your shop. This could be a tedious task, but a whole system has been put in place in order to help you out.</description>

      <description>Theme organization Directory structure A PrestaShop theme is a set of files which you can edit in order to change the look of your online shop.
Here are a few important tidbits:
 All themes have their files located in the /themes folder, at the root of PrestaShop&amp;rsquo;s folder. Each theme has its own sub-folder, in the main themes folder. Each theme is made of template files (.tpl), image files (.</description>

      <description>How to migrate a Grid/CRUD page In PrestaShop&amp;rsquo;s Back Office, most of the pages are organized the same way.
We can already see 2 categories of pages that represent almost 90% of back office:
 Configuration pages: forms that alter the configuration; CRUD pages: pages with a filterable/searchable table of data and some options to access a form of creation/edition;  CRUD pages provide a lot of features.
Access to a lot of data, ordered by column: this data can be simple (text) or more complex (display a thumbnail).</description>

      <description>Theme.yml The theme&amp;rsquo;s theme.yml file defines all of the theme&amp;rsquo;s configuration and meta information, such as its version number, layouts, compatibility range, hook configuration, etc.
Theme description The theme&amp;rsquo;s name MUST match its directory name. For instance, if the theme is named &amp;ldquo;My Awesome Theme&amp;rdquo; and its &amp;lsquo;name&amp;rsquo; value is set to &amp;ldquo;my-awesome-theme&amp;rdquo;, then the folder MUST be /my-awesome-theme .
Users will be able to choose the layout for each page from the theme&amp;rsquo;s settings page.</description>

If you want to theme to appears in the backoffice, it&amp;rsquo;s simply have to contain a config/theme.yml file. This will only display it, if you want to select it as your active theme, it has to be valid.</description>

      <description>Migrating from PrestaShop 1.6 PrestaShop 1.7 introduces a totally reworked theme system from version 1.6, with the goal of making PrestaShop upgrades easier, and making it easier and faster to create a brand new theme.
The huge change to the theme system means that there is no easy way to migrate your PrestaShop 1.6 theme to PrestaShop 1.7.
When using the automatic upgrade from PrestaShop 1.6 to 1.7, your theme will be switched to the new default theme, called &amp;ldquo;Classic&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <guid>https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/themes/reference/overriding-modules/</guid>
      <description>Overriding modules When you write a theme, you often need to override the templates and assets coming from a module so that they match your theme&amp;rsquo;s specific markup needs. Themes can override modules&amp;rsquo; assets (CSS and JavaScript only) by placing the corresponding file at a specific location.
With PrestaShop 1.7, all module overriding code goes to the modules directory (in your module&amp;rsquo;s own directory). Every PS 1.7 module developer should be aware of this change (introduced with PR 5020: https://github.</description>

      <description>Parent/child theme PrestaShop 1.7 relies a lot on template inheritance in order to create the most consistent theme possible while heavily reducing the amount of duplicated code.
We took it even further introducing the Parent Child theme feature. The point to is to avoid modifying the main theme so you can update it!
This feature is only useful if you want to slightly modify a theme (to add a block for example).</description>

      <description>RTL support PrestaShop supports RTL (Right-to-left) themes natively.
RTL stylesheets There are two ways of customizing your theme for RTL: either by adding an override file that is only loaded for RTL languages, or by using completely different version of the theme&amp;rsquo;s stylesheets.
CSS override file PrestaShop will try to load a css file named rtl.css after your theme&amp;rsquo;s ones when displayed in an RTL language. You can use this file to place any style override you need for RTL.</description>

      <description>Right-to-Left languages PrestaShop supports Right-to-Left (RTL) languages natively, both in the Back Office and the Front Office. It can automatically transform themes to make them compatible with RTL languages.
Any Front Office theme can be transformed automatically by PrestaShop. Read &amp;ldquo;RTL support&amp;rdquo; in the Themes section to learn more about this system.
Back Office support The Back Office uses the same &amp;ldquo;theme-flipping&amp;rdquo; system as the Front Office feature. While for Front Office themes the transformation procedure must be triggered manually, in the BO this is performed automatically whenever an RTL language is activated on the shop, either by installing an RTL language or by setting up a language as RTL via edit in the BO.</description>

{url} uses the Link class internally.
Please see the $urls dataset to find already regenerated urls (such as home, cart, login and so on).
 An instance of the Link object is still passed to the templates for backward compatibility purposes, since it was heavily used.</description>

      <description>About Webpack  Webpack is a module bundler. Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.
 The main interest of using Webpack is that it will compile all your styles - which we advise you to write using Sass  - into a single CSS file. This way, your theme will make only one HTTP request for this single file, and since your browser will cache it for later re-use, it will even donwload this file only once.</description>
